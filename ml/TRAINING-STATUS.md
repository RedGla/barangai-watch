## Tree repair completed — 20 October 2026 (latest; supersedes running notes below)

All four local CPU comparisons completed on the corrected **199-image** package, 155/18/26 split. Both architectures ran 10 epochs in none/balanced conditions. All validation macro F1 scores are 1.0; predefined ties select unweighted EfficientNet-B0. Test results: none EfficientNet 24/26, tree 1/2; none MobileNet 26/26, tree 2/2; balanced EfficientNet 25/26, tree 1/2; balanced MobileNet 25/26, tree 2/2 with one tree false alarm. Test scores did not change selection.

The selected candidate and existing v3 each score 10/12 on the reserved Philippine diagnostic. Candidate labels both garbage photos as trees; v3 has one tree false alarm. At unchanged 0.8 cutoff candidate accepts zero suggestions, versus four correct v3 suggestions; neither accepts a tree suggestion. All four diagnostic trees are one storm event; no potholes evaluated. No tuning used these photos. **Retain v3 in the local demo**; replacement is not justified by this evidence.

Image/split preservation, all four checkpoint hashes/metadata, class weights, histories and CSV metrics verified. Selected API preprocessing replay matches all 44 validation/test predictions within 1e-5 probability tolerance. Reserved metrics independently recomputed. Focused inference/ML tests: 21 passed. Checkpoints omit saved epoch/optimizer/RNG state; histories support completion. See [complete v4 report](TRAINING-RESULTS-V4-2026-10-20.md), private `verification-both.json` and `final-audit.json`. No training remains active; the PID file is historical. Earlier 201-image Kaggle input remains obsolete.

Remaining gates: diverse independent event data, fresh field evaluation and calibration, physical-phone camera/gallery/GPS, live provider privacy/database checks, hosting measurements and authorized deployment, human language/user evaluation and retention decision. No paid compute, billing, commit, push, deployment or model replacement occurred.

## Tree repair resumed - 20 October 2026 (historical)

Browser access restored and Kaggle Draft Session off confirmed. The old private Kaggle Tree Repair v4 dataset has the superseded201-image package, including two final rejects. Do not use its old run as final evidence. Correct local package is training-v4-final:199images,155train/18val/26test,32trainingtrees.

## Local model integration - 20 October 2026

CPU Torch 2.11.0 and TorchVision 0.26.0 are installed in the ignored project .venv. The reviewed EfficientNet checkpoint loads with its approved SHA-256 and matching preprocessing. The real-checkpoint API test passed with a synthetic photo: preview, manual resident category, private saved image and access denied after logout. Runtime forward errors now return an unavailable prediction while manual reporting succeeds. Invalid hashes, configuration and dependencies still prevent startup.

The standard API suite passed 91 tests, with the opt-in model test skipped. The separate real-model and focused inference suite passed six tests. The website production build passed. The local presentation launcher, deploy/start-local.ps1, serves the built website and API with two CPU threads and a demo-only 0.8 cutoff. This cutoff is not calibrated. No embedding quality is claimed. Review caught a remote-environment risk in the launcher; it now always uses the local SQLite database and local private image folder, overriding inherited remote storage settings.

Browser smoke passed on http://127.0.0.1:8001: synthetic photo selection and preview, real model response showing uncertainty, manual category, successful submission and history with separate resident/model/verified categories. Evidence: artifacts/model-integration-2026-10-20/resident-report-proof.png. An older server occupies port 8000 and was left running. The model-enabled server remains on port 8001.

No retraining, public deployment, paid service, commit or push occurred. Independent Philippine evaluation, known tree failures, deployment-host measurements and physical-phone tests remain outstanding.

# Training status — 20 October 2026

## Latest user correction and acquisition — supersedes older source gates

The user explicitly permits non-Philippine training data and specifically approved smark's Roboflow `road-potholes-and-cracks-jmxtp` dataset as supplementary. Country verification is required only for claiming Philippine origin; unknown country does not itself block supplementary inclusion. Keep uploader-declared CC BY 4.0 attribution and review actual images/labels.

Official UI COCO export version 6 completed: **566,213,926 bytes**, SHA256 `65da88930d67e29b9d79d83f99f8bf39ca2237869a197b53cfc2af6d58566c4d`, ZIP CRC passed. Saved in `artifacts/dataset-expansion-2026-10-20/roboflow-smark/`. Inventoried 4,682 augmented images, 4,101 train / 386 validation / 195 test, and 10,895 annotations; source project lists 1,948 images. Reviewed 24 pothole candidates; three clear full-source/crop candidates passed manifest validation. Other samples include severe noise, cracks, TV/news logos and infographic overlays; exclude these. Original capture country/photographers are unknown. No paid training, account change, upload or model activation occurred. Do not equate generated copies or generic filename prefixes with independent scenes.

Next: review cleaner variants/more clear positives, exclude unpermitted overlays, check cross-source duplicates, preserve existing frozen holdouts and prepare a supplementary training expansion. The dataset has been acquired and sampled, not fully curated or trained. See its private README and inventory. Continue at the five-hour reset if usage reaches 1%; reported reset20October2026 at20:30:22Asia/Manila.

Meanwhile `artifacts/dataset-expansion-2026-10-20/philippine-current/` contains **15 validated real Philippine candidates across all five classes**, eight conservative groups: floods 6, trees 4, garbage 2, potholes 2, damaged signage 1. File paths/hashes and empty derivative EXIF passed. No split assigned. One Flickr pothole photograph is CC BY-NC 2.0 for noncommercial academic use; its municipality is unknown and it is training-only. Existing Davao/Calumpit pilot images remain separate. No new training run; prior metrics unchanged. Older statements that pothole/sign positives remain zero are historical.

## Completed

- User-requested scheduled resume task deleted. Do not recreate it without another request. Keep the user's pause-at1%-remaining usage rule for future work.
- Ground-level-only pilot:75reviewed photos across allfiveclasses;47train/9validation/19test. Aerial flood and watermarked Kaggle samples excluded. Attribution, rights records, derived event groups, image hashes and original GIGO test placement preserved.

- Downloaded both checkpoints, actual results, validation/test probabilities, environment and frozen split into `artifacts/training/2026-10-20-ground-level-pilot/`. ZIPCRC, checkpoint sizes and splitdigest checked.
- Kaggle private notebook QuickSave version1 completed. Session explicitly stopped and UI confirmed DraftSessionoff. No training remains running.

## Interpretation and remaining work

This is a tiny training smoke experiment, not reliable production accuracy. EfficientNet-B0 missed the sole held-out pothole and2/3held-out flood examples; confidence is low. No production threshold was calibrated, no localAPI model was activated and no deployment occurred. Next useful work is more diverse permitted ground-level data and independent local evaluation; extra epochs alone do not resolve sample limitations.

Full results and reproducibility: [TRAINING-RESULTS-2026-10-20.md](TRAINING-RESULTS-2026-10-20.md).

Local Torch/TorchVision is not installed. Real checkpoint loading in the local API and deployment-host memory/latency remain untested. Kaggle CPU timings are not hosting benchmarks. Existing resident categorization and staff verification remain necessary.

## Closer-photo expansion and Philippine priority — 20 October 2026

User now prioritizes genuinely Philippine photos, with close ground-level views. Foreign sources are supplementary; do not label imported foreign photos as Philippine. No new training was launched after this correction.

Prepared local `artifacts/dataset-expansion-2026-10-20/close-set-v2/`:166real closer photos (93UKpotholes,22author-owned damagedsign crops,27flooding,16GIGOgarbage,8trees).

## Philippine acquisition after the five-hour reset — latest

Resumed after usage reset; deleted `resume-barangai-after-five-hour-usage-reset` once fulfilled. This supersedes the earlier scheduling notes. No GPU session is running.

Saved `artifacts/dataset-expansion-2026-10-20/philippine-reviewed/`: **12 new real Philippine images**, six flooding, four fallen trees and two accumulated roadside garbage. Source records, actual visual decisions, crop coordinates, attribution and source/derivative hashes are preserved. Project manifest validation passed all twelve file paths and SHA256 values; accepted derivatives have no EXIF. Related views share conservative groups. The country-only flood has municipality unknown and is restricted to a training candidate, excluded from local evaluation.

Not included in that count: previous Davao tree and three Calumpit pilot floods. Separate references: one healthy Benguet sign, three unlabeled Navotas shoreline-waste crops. Local pothole and damaged-sign positives remain zero; no rights or origin inferred from repository licenses, titles or badges. No synthetic data was generated.

No train/validation/test split assigned and no new upload/training run. This is a partial collection, not complete local coverage or verified field accuracy. More independent local photos are necessary, especially potholes and visibly damaged signs. See [PHILIPPINE-DATASET-SOURCES.md](PHILIPPINE-DATASET-SOURCES.md) and private per-source reviews for actual gates. Prior pilot metrics and model activation status are unchanged.

## Resumed 20 October 2026 at 20:31 Manila — supplementary v3 prepared

Usage reset confirmed; fulfilled one-time resume automation deleted. Reviewed 48 Roboflow crops and source frames. Six retained: sample6,11,17 and extra4,6,19. Extra21 is a visually confirmed mirrored/resized duplicate of an existing v2 training photograph and excluded. Byte/decoded-image and perceptual screening flagged no selected overlap with the 28 frozen pilot holdouts; heuristic screening does not prove independent events. Whole smark source collection remains training-only under one conservative group; country and original photographers unknown, rights uploader-declared CC BY4.0.

Prepared close-set-v3:172 images (99 potholes,22 signs,27 floods,16 garbage,8 trees),128 train/18 validation/26 test.
