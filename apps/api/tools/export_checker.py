"""Export MobileCLIP2-S0's image encoder to ONNX and pre-compute the category prompt embeddings.

The API's category checker (barangai/checker.py) then needs only onnxruntime, numpy and Pillow: no torch,
no text encoder at runtime. Run from the repo root with the project venv (needs open_clip_torch, onnx):

    .venv/Scripts/python.exe apps/api/tools/export_checker.py                 # model and prompts
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe apps/api/tools/export_checker.py --prompts-only  # prompts only

Weights: timm/MobileCLIP2-S0-OpenCLIP on Hugging Face, Apple ML research licence (apple-amlr): research use
only, which covers this academic prototype. Change PROMPTS below and re-run to retune the checker.
