"""Combines the vision model (vision.py) and the checker (checker.py) into one form suggestion.

The vision model leads: it is the only one that can write a description. The checker confirms its category
(both agree: filled with no warning), stands in when the vision model is unavailable, and always supplies the
duplicate-review embedding. Results are kept briefly by photo hash so submitting a previewed photo neither
spends Cloudflare neurons again nor lets the client choose the model's category.
